# Overview of figures generated from the notebook

Tis notebook ist based on the notebook otebook `sr15_2.4.2.3_ccs_deployment`
generating **Figure 2.17**: CCS deployment in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways for biomass, coal
     and natural gas, and the cumulative quantity of carbon dioxide stored
	 
It is modiefied in a way that the pathways for bioenergy, coal and natural gas are generated for deployment with and without CCS.
