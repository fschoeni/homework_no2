## Description

Repository for the second homework during the course (SS2020)

The project was created for the purpose of the lecture "Open Source Energy System Modeling" in spring 2020 held as an online format. 
In this work, I conduct analyses with the IAMC 1.5°C Explorer to derive certain findings.
